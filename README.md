# PlutoIPTV

Grab EPG & M3U from Pluto.tv


## Usage

Install npm also known as node  from https://nodejs.org/en/
Once that is installed, then download package.json and index.js to C:\IPTV

open a command prompt in IPTV and type:   ```npx pluto-iptv```
It will spin for a few seconds and then work its magic.


This will create an `plutotv.xml` file and a `plutotv.m3u` file
